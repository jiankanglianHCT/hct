1、Project overview
HealthyChain is a decentralized intelligent sports health management service
platform, which is based on block chain technology, AI intelligent wearable
hardware, distributed nodes, and jointly constructs and completes
HealthyChain system to realize the global distributed service platform DAPP. Healthy Chain is committed to building a global sports health data exchange, trust exchange, value interconnection block chain sports fitness service
platform, integrating sports social, e-commerce games, media information, building fitness for all, sharing a healthy global block chain sports financial
ecosystem is Healthy Chain's mission
1.1 Internet+Development Course of Sports Fitness
In this situation, HealthyChain team began to build a new generation of
block chain technology to support the DAPP project of Internet + AI intelligent
hardware products. A large number of research on active participation in sports shows that the
economic method has the highest incentive effect and score, which means that
people have the highest enthusiasm for sports finance. Healthy Chain actively
provides innovative sports finance products, especially sports cash products, which stimulates more people's enthusiasm for participation and cultivates
第6页
sports habits for all. The original intention of HealthyChain Health Chain is to enable users to
know their own sports data and health data at any time by using smart
wearable hardware, and to exchange the sports data for the TOKEN award of
HealthyChain. It is an effective exercise realization, using HealthyChain to
distribute in the nodes of global sports venues and DAPP.The value sharing of
platform content realizes the output and consumption of Token, gradually
realizes the sharing of sports fitness venues and coaches, and any venue in the
world with Healthy Chain nodes can exercise and exercise. In the future, users
of Healthy Chain will gradually realize the diversified functions of social, payment, media, etc., improve user experience, and build up. Healthy Chain's
healthy financial ecosystem. 1.2 Block chain is the general trend
On October 31, 2008, Zhongbencong released the Bitcoin White Paper "A
Point-to-Point Electronic Cash System", announcing the arrival of value
transmission network. Bitcoin has many commendable designs, such as
tamper-proof, data backup, relatively anonymous participants, and no need for
other trusts. But its own trading performance and workload proof (POW)
consensus mechanism has gradually revealed problems. Block chain
technology is derived from Bitcoin. In the past two years, geeks have mainly
第7页
innovated around block chain's transaction performance, consensus algorithm, security anonymity, such as NEO, EOS, etc. to improve transaction performance;
Proof of of Stake (POS), proof of delegated interest (DPOS), etc. Practical
Byzantine Fault Tolerance（Practical Byzantine Fault Tolerance，PBFT for short）
Enrichment and improvement of consensus algorithm, Zero-knowledge Proof
(ZKP) and mixed currency to enhance transaction security. Healthy Chain DAPP
will continue to build a basic platform, develop and iterate various products
and commercial landing projects, gradually form a block chain economy with
the core of sports, sports, health and rehabilitation medicine, improve the
efficiency of the industry and promote the efficient and coordinated
development of society. Health Chain DAPP ecology defines a new type of
block chain economy. 1.3 HealthyChain.Meaning
1) Token gives productivity to sports, fitness and training, makes content
sharing, participants'biometric information and sports health data valuable, and makes it possible for people to keep fit, interact and exchange values
without borders. 2) Block chain technology solves the problem of trust and value transfer. Only by decentralization can we achieve the true sense of fairness, openness
and transparency, and more people will participate in the formation of an
第8页
ecological sports fitness business system. 3) Every gymnasium participating in the community will be a distributed
node of Healthy Chain. The venue can reward HCT to get more customers and
accept customers'payment for HCT, realize the circulation of HCT, let users
optimize the environment of gymnasium in the sports and fitness industry, improve service and technology, and make the whole industry develop
healthily and vigorously. 4) HealthyChain can develop a 3D motion track capture and recording system
for professional athletes in the future. Wearable smart chips and advanced
algorithms are used to record and present every movement and every training
in 3D. It can be widely used in schools, sports training, medical diagnosis and
other fields. 5) Advantages: Users use a variety of scenarios to support a variety of sports
models, AI smart wearable hardware, big data, globalization, everyone can
participate, so that sharing sports and fitness venues, sharing coaches is
possible
1.4 HealthyChain.Development Planning
Block chain technology is the most potential, imaginative and radical
technological innovation in the world. The biggest characteristic of block chain
is decentralization, which can realize the exchange of point-to-point value. It is
第9页
called value internet. The goal of HealthyChain is to create a single node where
users and users can interact directly.As a big node, fitness venues are a strong
cooperative ecological system with mutual cooperation, point-to-point
exchange and value-driven under the consensus of the community and society. Healthy Chain will achieve these goals in three phases. Firstly, we use block chain technology to build a secure and stable DAPP
platform, which can realize intelligent contracts and digital assets. At the same
time, we will introduce intelligent hardware bracelets that can intelligently
monitor movement and body status to ensure accurate and detailed user
motion data and avoid cheating. Secondly, we use cloud data to meet different business needs, such as
insurance, medical care, personal biometric authentication, personal credit
records, etc. This stage will realize an evolving, easy-to-use, highly viscous and
diversified DAP platform. Finally, through the virtual digital currency (HCT), we connect the data of
each user, including the data interaction with other platforms (including
non-block chains), and construct an interconnected, multi-dimensional data
interrelated DAPP sports health financial ecosystem. Multidimensional data, such as personal credit, assets, production and consumption data, can better
integrate community consensus, individual behavior and value exchange.
第10页
Token carries the value of the ecological system. Holding HCT will obtain the
basic services of various services in the financial ecological system of sports
health, sports and fitness venues, sports and fitness surrounding malls, sharing
sports and fitness community technology and data resources. 1.5 HealthyChain.Design Concept
The goal of HealthyChain is to create a strong cooperative ecosystem in which
users and users can interact directly, users can act as a single node, gymnasiums as a large node, cooperate with each other, exchange point to
point, and drive by value under the consensus of the community and society. Health chain is committed to helping everyone build a reasonable and fun
sports fitness scenario; through AI intelligent wearing equipment to collect
user fitness, sports data and health data, to establish user health data
information and upload to the chain, to provide valuable data for medical
rehabilitation. Through the analysis of big data, we can provide scientific
exercise method guidance and practical exercise plan, so that everyone can
participate in sports and fitness to get better exercise and fitness experience
and share the commercial value of sports. Finally, we can promote everyone to
participate in sports, fitness, improve sub-health, and harvest strong physique. Keep a low carbon life. To this end, we design on the basis of the following
principles and logic:
第11页
1) Reasonable: In this ecosystem, every natural person and other business
forms can participate in it. Our design scheme must benefit all parties in
order to make the healthy chain ecology develop steadily for a long time. Only in this way can the block chain and Internet technology really serve
the vision of people's life. 2) Fun: Fun can make more people participate in it easily, so that the body
and mind can develop healthily. We design various funny functions to let
everyone exercise, exercise, socialize and make money in a relaxed and
joyful environment. 3) Fairness: The system treats each participant fairly, and this kind of
fairness is generally acknowledged as fairness, which is supported by a
decentralized block chain voting mechanism and intelligent contract. HealthyChain.Design Concept
4) Opening and sharing: Opening and sharing is one of the design principles of
the system. Faced with all kinds of individuals and institutions related to fitness
and health, everyone and institutions can access the platform to share their
第12页
own skills, venues, equipment, data and other resources, so that the overall
value of the system and the benefits of participants can be continuously
improved. 5) Freedom: Each participant in the system can freely exchange skills, generate
transactions, play together, and mine together. 6) Transparency: All transactions, exchanges, mining, social networking and
other rules are established and implemented on the basis of block chains and
smart contracts, to ensure that the payment and return, ability and resources
are reasonably reflected, reciprocal transactions, and to ensure that the records
of the whole process are open, transparent and unalterable. At this stage, HealthyChain is a digital currency asset issued on the basis of
intelligent contracts using ETH block chains at the bottom. ETH can
theoretically reach 1000TPS (transaction per second), each transfer and mining
incentives need to pay commissions, for users, mining incentives may not arrive
in real time. Later, based on the basic chain of DAG technology, we will put stability, security, scalability and ease of use in the first place in design. By introducing
modular virtual machines, smart sandboxes, value exchange and bifurcation
mechanisms, we can create an evolving, easy-to-use, low-cost and moderately
customized block chain network, such as trustNote, to issue new digital assets.
第13页
DAG (directed acyclic graph) is called "directed acyclic graph". There is no block
concept. Instead of packaging all data into blocks and linking blocks with
blocks, each user can submit a data unit, which can contain many elements, such as transactions, messages and so on. DAG (Directed Acyclic Graph) is
formed by linking data units with reference relation. DAG is characterized by
asynchronizing the write operation of data units. A large number of wallet
clients can write transaction data into DAG independently and asynchronically, which can support great concurrency and high speed. Furthermore, based on
the DAG consensus mechanism, block-chain digital assets can be transferred at
a very fast speed without any fees. For the fitness chain, after using the DAG
basic chain, even if the number of users is increasing, token incentives can also
be guaranteed to reach the accounts in real time. Healthy Chain believes
that,Through technological innovation, we can solve the problem of trust
between people and create a new network of production relations, better
integrate community consensus, individual behavior and value exchange. After issuing new digital assets, digital assets will be guaranteed to be
converted in equal proportion at this stage. 1.6 HealthyChain.Application scenarios
Identity information establishment, credit inquiry. User identity
authentication includes biological information, such as face recognition. With
第14页
the application of DAPP platform in cross-border e-commerce and the
accumulation of block chain technology, credit-related data will be deposited in
the chain. By authorization, users'syndrome letters can be searched, and a
highly reliable credit mechanism can be evolved. User identity authentication, bioinformatics, credit information and other comprehensive information
databases can be established to promote digital asset finance. For service. Through rehabilitation training, we can set up vital signs data, physical
examination reports, biological health data such as genetic diseases and
chronic diseases to link up, open up the problem of isolated medical
examination and hospital information island, and provide detailed reference
basis for health insurance companies, non-drug treatment, rehabilitation
training and other institutions through user authorization, so as to protect
them. Household privacy. Cross-border trade goods traceability, anti-counterfeiting. With the
continuous iteration of DAPP, cross-border e-commerce will also be online in
DAPP to support digital currency settlement, and use Token to change billing
and malicious evaluation, to achieve real credit evaluation, to ensure that SKU is
good and cheap. At the same time, block chain technology is gradually used to
track, upload and verify the whole process of commodity import, which will
give each cross-border import a unique "block identity" for consumers to check
and verify, to ensure the authenticity and reliability of commodity sources, and
第15页
fundamentally eliminate counterfeits. HealthyChain Ecology already has partners of game manufacturers. After
DAPP joins the game manufacturers in the later stage, Token will support the
acquisition, circulation and trading of small game props. Global users, digital assets easy to trade. Under the premise of abiding by
the laws of all countries, TOKEN is used to purchase and use goods of all
countries conveniently and quickly, share the value of content, and trade in
places where the Internet can be accessed, so as to imagine the function of
convenient payment without borders. 1.7 Overview of HealthyChain Smart Handrings
The first generation of smart hardware is a universal hardware bracelet that
manages digital assets based on HealthyChain and establishes incentive
systems for users through smart contracts. Intelligent bracelet has been cooperated by well-known factories in the
industry, and engineering machines have been introduced. The first version of
the smart bracelet will have similar functions as the existing bracelet. At the
same time, it will be adapted to DAPP for health coin mining. The first batch of
supporters from the HealthyChain community will use the mass-produced DAP
第16页
and HealthyChain bracelets after mass production, and continue to optimize
the HealthyChain bracelets according to user feedback. Sports bracelet is a set of running, cycling, fast walking and other sports
mode as one of the hardware equipment. As long as the power supply of the
bracelet is kept on and connected to the mobile phone, all the functions of the
ordinary bracelet can be realized. Based on HealthyChain's ecological incentive
mechanism, users can contribute their own sports data to get HTC rewards, accurately collect user's sports data, effectively filter invalid steps, eliminate
cheating, and encourage everyone to keep fit. The internal structure and
configuration of each bracelet are highly unified when it leaves the factory, so
as to ensure the stability of all bracelets and facilitate maintenance. 1.8 HealthyChain.Ecosphere

1.9 Development Prospects of Health Chain
1) The team has many years of practical experience in the fitness industry and
tens of millions of precise fitness members. 2) There are hundreds of millions of people in the fitness market. 3) Intelligent Hardware Manufacturers Sharing Lenovo OEM
4) Data show that in 2017, 37627 gyms in China have conservatively estimated
annual membership of more than 100 million. The penetration rate of Chinese
fitness population is only 0.79%, far less than 17.82% in the United States. China's fitness market still has tremendous room for growth. 5) Overseas developed countries have more and more people take fitness as an
indispensable part of their lives, and the number of users in overseas markets is
第18页
huge.

2、Public chain(HCT)
2.1 Health uses
Public Chain (HCT) is the digital asset passport of health chain ecosystem. It
can be obtained through the health chain wearable intelligent hardware mining. The mining process is closely related to the use of scenarios, users'health status, and the operation of health institutions. The public chain (HCT) is the most
important link in the health chain ecosystem. It plays the role of trading media, value transfer, rewards, game props, social lubricants and so on. It has a wide
range of application scenarios. As the application scenarios become more and more extensive, the public
chain (HCT) has long-term value-added expectations; and with the increasing
difficulty of mining, the value of the public chain (HCT) will become higher and
higher, and the earlier it is obtained, the greater value-added space will be
obtained. 2.2 Public Chain (HCT) Incentive Mechanism
Public Chain (HCT) is based on the design concept of HealthyChain smart
hardware, connecting mobile phones and collecting user's trajectory. It
combines hardware, mobile phones and user's motion integrated data
principle to design a unique intelligent adjustment mining algorithm. Based on
artificial intelligence, a scientific scoring mechanism is formulated according to
the daily amount of exercise, the acceleration of specific scenes, the daily time
第20页
of exercise, the comprehensive data of exercise and the time cycle of fitness. According to the rating results of all users, tokens are awarded to users within
each time cycle. In theory, the higher the score, the more token rewards.
In HealthyChain's ecosystem, all users who adhere to fitness have the
possibility of getting a public chain (HCT) award. Each incentive chain (HCT)
indicates that users have paid sweat, time and spirit for fitness training. Public
Chain (HCT) is essentially a proof of user's workload. The total amount of HCT incentives in each cycle decreases with time. The
specific incentives can be found in the section of the fund utilization plan. 2.3 Public Chain (HCT) Trading Closed Loop
1) National Mining: Users can open the fitness mode at any time of the day. When the fitness intelligent hardware detects the data of the user's movement
speed and comprehensive data, it will automatically open the accelerated
calculation mode for a certain period of time. Each time cycle, according to the
user's surge situation, according to the system score. Mechanisms, give users a
certain amount of token incentives, in order to encourage users to develop a
habit of continuous exercise.
第21页
2) Sports Fitness Venues Consumption Support: Fitness users are both
producers and demanders. The public chain (HCT) awarded can be used to
consume and pay for gyms and personal trainers that have access to the Health
Chain system. 3) DAPP cross-border e-commerce consumer payment: within the scope
permitted by law, can support the use of HCT partial or full deduction of the
public chain (HCT) settlement, purchase the required goods, HCT consumption
cycle. 4) Value exchange, fitness content sharing, reward reading and other fitness
knowledge value payment circulation. 5) Business Drainage Award: Fitness venues are the producers. Fitness venues
connect to HealthyChain from the system, purchase public chains (HCT)
through third-party trading platform, and give users more public chains (HCT)
incentives in HealthyChain system, in order to attract more users to join the
gym and increase the continuing income of the gym. 4) Value exchange, fitness content sharing, reward reading and other fitness
knowledge value payment circulation. 5) Merchant Drainage Award: Fitness venues are the producers. Fitness
venues access Healthy Chain from the system, purchase health coins
through a third-party trading platform, and give users more health money
rewards in Healthy Chain system, so as to attract more users to join the
第22页
gym and increase the continuing income of the gym. 6) Shopping game props: HealthyChain relies on block chain technology, users can use the public chain (HCT) to exchange various services needed
for sports and fitness, fitness venues can also attract more users to enter
stores by issuing health money, forming a closed-loop transaction. 7) The total amount of the public chain (HCT) is constant, and the value of
the public chain (HCT) will increase with the flow rate. As the public chain
(HCT) continues to appreciate, we will continue to develop more trading
scenarios suitable for the public chain (HCT). In theory, business
transactions can be grafted onto the public chain (HCT). There are many
application scenarios. 8) Transaction value transfer: Users get a certain amount of public chain
(HCT) awards because of their fitness exercise, which can be used for
consumer support and realize the value transfer of fitness exercise. Healthy Chain Trading Closed Loop

3、Product Solutions
3.1 Product Solutions
At present, the popular design scheme of Internet product is MVP
(Minimum viable product). Starting from a minimal viable product, seed users
are accumulated. According to the feedback from seed users and background
monitoring data, products of Tencent are optimized rapidly and continuously. QQ and Weixindu are products of Tencent Department. In this way, what millet
company calls "small step, fast iteration" is also different from each other. HealthyChain's DAP and compatible hardware Bracelet products will adopt this
overlapping mode. HealthyChain.The product iteration scheme will be carried out step by step. MVP products will only realize the mining of hand rings on the basis of basic
functions of hand rings, such as movement mode (such as walking, climbing, running, cycling), data synchronization (real-time heart rate, real-time steps, real-time calories, sleep time). In the following stage, DAPP will gradually realize the industry compatibility of
multi-brand bracelets. For users of other bracelets, such as millet and Huawei
bracelets, we can also access our DAPP to achieve national fitness, Bracelet
mining function, and obtain corresponding tokens. In the future, it can even be
similar to smart watches, smart glasses and other bracelets. He has access to
smart devices. Ultimately, our DAPP will be a mature ecological community in
第24页
which supporters of the fitness chain community can make fitness friends, mine
for money, and use HCT tokens to buy a variety of products and services in the
community's Healthy Chain confectionery store. 3.2 Operational plan
Because Healthy Chain DAPP is a step-by-step, step-by-step optimization
path model, only seed users need to join the Healthy Chain community in the
early stage to participate in our product optimization work. We anticipate that
different promotion methods will be adopted at different stages to achieve
different user levels, and eventually we will put the concept of national fitness, national mining into the hearts of users who love life. HealthyChain DAPP. Product Operation Roadmap
4、Technical scheme
4.1 Healthy Chain Mining Mechanism
The health chain is based on artificial intelligence. It formulates a scientific
scoring mechanism according to the daily amount of exercise, the acceleration
of specific scenes, the daily time of exercise, the comprehensive data of exercise
and the time cycle of fitness. In each time cycle, users will issue tokens to users
based on the health chain intelligent hardware, connected mobile phones,
第25页
uploaded user fitness data and track, combined with the fitness chain scoring
mechanism. The total amount of tokens rewarded in each cycle decreases with
time. 4.2 Wearable Smart Hardware for Health Chain
Wearable intelligent hardware of health chain is an important terminal of
fitness chain system, including intelligent bracelet, intelligent fitness
equipment, intelligent gym and so on. Only when users wear smart hardware, their fitness data will be transmitted to the fitness chain scoring system. The
first generation of fitness bracelets will record the user's heart rate, sleep, steps, calories and other data, supporting a variety of sports models, such as running, cycling, fast walking, etc
4.3 Health Chain Technology Architecture
The health chain system architecture is mainly divided into three layers:
service layer, system layer and DAPP layer. The service layer mainly includes four basic services: big data service, AI
intelligent service, scoring system and block chain service. User's wearable
equipment generates time series data at every moment. Big data service is
responsible for carrying and storing massive movement data, and analyzing
and processing the data. Scoring system is the core service of token reward.
第26页
According to user's movement data, all fitness users'movement data are
evaluated in each time cycle. AI intelligent service mainly provides intelligent
scoring, scientific fitness plan recommendation and other services. Block chain
service is the basic service of health chain. The system layer is a function module built on the service layer to provide
services for DAPP. It mainly includes data collection function, message
notification function, token reward function, fitness plan recommendation
function, online shopping mall function and so on. DAPP is an application directly connected with intelligent devices such as smart
hand rings. All smart devices that can access the health chain need to be
connected to DAPP before they can connect the whole health chain. DAPP not
only connects with smart hand environment protection, but also includes token
wallet, sports community, online shopping mall and other functions.
Intelligent devices are responsible for identifying users'fitness patterns, collecting sports data, uploading data to the system through the connection
with DAPP, and receiving token awards.

5、Risk statement
5The following risks exist in this project. Investors should pay attention to them. 5.1. Market risk
Market risk means that the fitness chain is not accepted by the fitness
crowd, or not attracted enough users, resulting in insufficient profit
support. In view of this, the way to avoid danger for the fitness chain
team is as follows
Draw lessons from similar product operation experience, and improve
Healthy Chain;
Take advantage of the experience accumulated by the founding team
in fitness service to incubate platform ecology and generate profits.. 5.2. Technical risk
Technological risk refers to the major problems of underlying technology, which lead to the failure of HealthyChain system to achieve expected
functions, or the failure of data link due to the technical problems of
intelligent hardware. For technical risks, the HealthyChain team adopts
the following hedging methods:
